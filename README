Overview
========

Manages hosts.allow and hosts.deny.


Usage
=====

tcpwrappers
-----------

    include tcpwrappers

Installs the default "ALL: ALL" hosts.deny entry.

tcpwrappers::allow
------------------

    tcpwrappers::allow { foo:
        daemon => "daemon",
        client => "192.0.2.0/24";
    }

Adds the specified entry to hosts.allow. The namevar is not significant.

The following parameters are available:

  ensure
    Whether the entry should be "present" or "absent".
  daemon
    The identifier supplied to libwrap by the daemon, often just the
    process name.
  client
    The client specification to be added.

The client may be specified in any of the following forms:

  Domain suffix: .domain
  IP address:    192.0.2.1
  IP prefix:     192. 192.0. 192.0.2.
  IP range:      192.0.2.0/24 192.0.2.0/255.255.255.0

The client specification will be normalized before being compared with or
added to the existing entries in hosts.allow.


TODO
====

- Permit filenames as a client
- Add an optional $except parameter to manage the EXCEPT clause
  - Should work identically to $client, but Augeas lens must place
    entries continaing EXCEPT on separate lines
- Manage hosts.deny
